## Modelling the Predictive Power of Acoustic Monitoring

### Research question

> Is the predictive power of the current acoustic monitoring sufficient enough to estimate the true number of killed bats?

### Predictions

The predictive power of the acoustic monitoring for the extrapolation of the expected number of stroke victims is decreasing

* in case the crossing bats are not distributed uniformly or randomly.

* with increasing length of the rotor blades.

* for species with high-frequency echo calls.
